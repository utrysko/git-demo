Living easy
Loving free
Season ticket for a one way ride
Asking nothing
Leave me be
Taken everything in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I would rather do
Going down
By the time
My friends are gonna be there too.

I'm on a highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell.
